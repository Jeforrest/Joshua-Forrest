# Joshua-Forrest

Hello!  My name is Joshua Forrest and I am currently working on finishing the data analytics bootcamp at Tripleten.  
I'm fine tuning all of my analytical skills and slowly mastering all of the new tools at my disposal: PostgreSQL, Tableau, Python, and Excel.

I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan (GO BLUE 〽️), but I have lived and worked all over this beautiful country from Bristol Bay, Alaska, to Hauula, Hawaii, to Orlando, Florida.  I am currently living in Salem, Oregon working as an Emergency Medical Technician for the city and as a wildland firefighter with a contracting agency.  I am passionate about culture and am currently enrolled at Oregon State University in the Undergraduate Anthropology program with a focus in cultural and linguistic anthropology.  I am currently learning Spanish🇪🇸 and Te Reo Maori🇳🇿, and am somewhat proficient in both German🇩🇪 and the Hawaiian language🌺.  I live with my girlfriend and our 1 year old fur baby Opihi.  I love hiking, cooking, running, and surfing.  

I am very interested in participating in any outsourcing projects or freelance work that might be available.  I am also looking for full-time employment.  I am willing to work remotely or relocate for the right position.

I am well versed in Excel, Python, PostgreSQL, Tableau, and PowerBI.  I am a critical thinker and particularly enjoy exploratory data analysis.

I
